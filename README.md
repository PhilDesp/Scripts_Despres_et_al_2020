Scripts for "Perturbing proteomes at single residue resolution using base editing"

These repositories contain the scripts used to analyze data and generate figures for "Perturbing proteomes at single residue resolution using base editing". Data analysis was performed using the Jupyter Notebook (python 2.7) or the Jupyter Lab (python 3.6). A number of programs and packages were used to analyze data, and they are listed below:

The following programs were during data analysis: PANDA-Seq v2.11, Needle (EMBOSS v6.6.0.0), Bowtie v1.2.1.1, Rate4site 3.0.0, and FASTX v36.3.8. The following packages for Python 2.7 were used: pandas 0.23.4, matplotlib v2.2.3, numpy v1.15.4, scipy v1.1.0, seaborn v0.9.0, tqdm v4.32, and Biopython v1.71. For Python 3.6, the following packages were used: pandas v0.24.2, numpy v1.16.2, matplotlib v3.0.3, scipy v1.2.1 and seaborn v0.9.0.

Each notebook has its own repository, containing important files for running the associated notebooks. In some cases, the raw data files are too large to be hosted on the github repository. In these occurences, users should download the files on their computers manually and then run the notebooks. A Readme describing what figures and results, as well as files requiring manual download is present in each sub repository.
